A **Data Engineer** passionate about building reliable, scalable, and well-designed data pipelines. I enjoy working across the full data lifecycle — from ingestion and transformation to orchestration and exposure through APIs.

I’m especially motivated by **technical challenges** and **learning new technologies**, and I actively experiment with different data stacks in my personal projects.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Expertise

### **Data Transformation & Modeling**
- **Python & SQL** for data processing and analytics  
- Hands-on experience with:
  - **pandas** & **polars** for "small" data transformations
  - **dbt** for analytics engineering, testing, and data modeling
- Strong focus on clean, maintainable, and well-tested transformations

### **Big Data & Distributed Processing**
- **Apache Spark**
  - PySpark for data engineering workflows
  - Scala for performance-critical or JVM-based pipelines
- Experience handling large datasets and optimizing transformations

### **Workflow Orchestration**
- Designing and operating data pipelines using:
  - **Airflow**
  - **Prefect**
  - **Luigi**
- Comfortable with scheduling, dependency management, retries, and monitoring

### **Data APIs & Services**
- Building **REST APIs** with **FastAPI**
- Exposing data products and services in a clean, documented, and scalable way
- Experience integrating APIs into data platforms and pipelines

## 🏀 Personal Projects

In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with **ETL pipelines on NBA data**, using different technologies and architectures to:

- Test new tools and frameworks
- Compare performance and developer experience
- Practice real-world data modeling and orchestration patterns

These projects are playgrounds for innovation, learning, and pushing my data engineering skills further.
