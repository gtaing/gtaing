A Data Engineer passionate about building reliable, scalable, and well-designed data pipelines. I enjoy working across the full data lifecycle — from ingestion and transformation to orchestration and exposure through APIs.

I’m especially motivated by technical challenges and learning new technologies, and I actively experiment with different data stacks in my personal projects.
