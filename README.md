I build reliable and scalable data pipelines.

I mostly work with **Python & SQL** for data transformations (using pandas, polars, and dbt).

I have hands-on experience with **Apache Spark** (both PySpark and Scala).

For orchestration, I use **Airflow, Prefect, and Luigi**.

I also build **REST APIs with FastAPI** to expose data products.

I love technical challenges and learning new technologies 🚀  

In my free time, I experiment with ETL pipelines on **NBA data** using different data stacks.

You can find me here on GitHub — feel free to explore my projects!
